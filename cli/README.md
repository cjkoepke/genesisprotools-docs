# GPT-CLI
Genesis Pro Tools offers an open-source Command Line Interface that interacts with the Genesis Pro Tools directory structure.

It offers quick and easy commands that automate a lot of setup processes for both Composer and Node commands, including template file generation and more.

## Installation
Assuming you have [Node installed](../requirements/#node), you can install GPT-CLI globally by running the following command:

```bash
sudo npm i gpt-cli -g
```

Once installed, you can check the successful installation by running `gpt -v` in your terminal. You should get a version number output.
