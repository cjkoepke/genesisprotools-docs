# Getting Started
Genesis Pro Tools is a suite of Composer packages built with specifically with the Genesis Framework in mind.

Some packages will likely work with other themes (such as JavaScript libraries and easy development functions), but only development
in the context of the Genesis Framework is supported (for paying customers).

There are both free and premium packages: the free packages are licensed under the standard GPL license used by WordPress. Premium
packages are proprietary and are only accessible with a valid `username` and `token`.

## Requirements
Genesis Pro Tools includes some basic dependencies for development, both of which are open-source and have their own documentations
available to the public. For convenience, we have added some basic instructions for installing these requirements on your machine.

Exhaustive instructions can be found at the linked documentation under each requirement.

- [Node Instructions](/requirements/#node)

## GPT-CLI
The Genesis Pro Tools CLI is currently in beta, but is available to use for both the Core Theme Package installation as well as the Uno Starter Theme installation.
